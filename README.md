# Bar-chart.html
This is basically a javascript implementation of creatinfg a self automated bar chart.
it consists of two modes:-
1)NORMAL MODE-In this mode when we click the button a pop-up window appears asking for a value,which when given a bar of that height and predefined width appears.
2)HACKER MODE-It is almost similar to the NORMAL mode with the difference that the graphs are automatically arranged in the ascending order.

It is quite easy to operate.:)
